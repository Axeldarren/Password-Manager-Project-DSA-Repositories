# DSA Password Manager

Welcome to the DSA Password Manager repository!

This project serves as a comprehensive Password Manager, designed and implemented using C++. It leverages the robustness of the Caesar Cipher algorithm for encryption and employs linked lists, classes, and data flushing to ensure data security and efficient management.

## Features
- **Encryption**: Utilizes the Caesar Cipher algorithm for robust data encryption.
- **Linked List Implementation**: Employs linked lists for optimized data organization.
- **Class Implementation**: Utilizes classes for structured and organized code.

## Usage
To use the DSA Password Manager:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C++ files using your preferred compiler.
3. Run the executable to start using the Password Manager.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to manage your passwords securely.
